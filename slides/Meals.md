To address the task of classifying and scaling meals without their variants, I recommend the following strategy:

### Strategy for Classifying and Scaling Meals

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Extract unique meal names from the `order_item` table, ensuring that variants (e.g., "chicken burger", "vegan burger") are normalized to a common base meal name ("burger").
   - Remove duplicates and standardize meal names to avoid any inconsistencies.

2. **Category Definition:**
   - Define a limited set of high-level meal categories. Based on the provided second attachment, here are potential categories:
     - Additive
     - Bakery
     - Beverage
     - Cereal
     - Condiment
     - Dairy
     - Dish
     - Essential Oil
     - Fish
     - Flower
     - Fruit
     - Fungi
     - Herb
     - Legume
     - Maize
     - Meat
     - Nuts and Seeds
     - Plant
     - Plant Derivative
     - Seafood
     - Spice
     - Vegetable
   - Map each meal to one of these categories based on its primary characteristics.

3. **Database Structuring:**
   - Use the existing model as a basis, ensuring the `order_item` table is linked correctly to the `main_category` and `group_category` tables.
   - Create additional tables or fields if necessary to better capture the relationship between meals and their categories.

4. **Indexing for Scalability:**
   - Implement database indexing on key fields such as `dishName`, `meal_type`, `main_category`, and `group_category` to improve query performance.
   - Consider using composite indexes where appropriate to optimize searches involving multiple criteria.

5. **Menu Generation:**
   - Develop a query or a series of queries to generate menus based on the categorized meal data.
   - Ensure the queries are optimized for performance, especially if the dataset is large.

6. **Open Source Tools and Libraries:**
   - Use open-source libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `SQLAlchemy` for database operations in Python.
   - Consider using Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities if needed.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Extract and Clean Data:**
   - Write a script to extract unique meal names from the `order_item` table.
   - Normalize the meal names to remove variants.

2. **Define Categories:**
   - Create a mapping of meal names to high-level categories.

3. **Database Schema Update:**
   - Update the database schema if necessary to ensure proper indexing and relationships.

4. **Menu Generation Query:**
   - Develop and test the query to generate the menu.

Here is a sample Python script outline for data extraction and normalization:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from the database (example using pandas and SQLAlchemy)
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')
order_items = pd.read_sql_table('order_item', engine)

# Normalize meal names (example function, expand as needed)
def normalize_meal_name(meal_name):
    base_name = meal_name.split()[0]  # Simplistic approach, improve as needed
    return base_name

order_items['normalized_dishName'] = order_items['dishName'].apply(normalize_meal_name)

# Remove duplicates
unique_meals = order_items['normalized_dishName'].unique()

# Define categories (example mapping, expand as needed)
categories = {
    'burger': 'Dish',
    'pizza': 'Dish',
    'salad': 'Dish',
    # Add more mappings
}

# Map meals to categories
order_items['category'] = order_items['normalized_dishName'].map(categories)

# Save back to the database or use for further processing
order_items.to_sql('order_item', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

### Visualization of Schema
To visualize and understand the schema, refer to the first attachment. Ensure that all relationships and foreign keys are correctly defined to support the queries and operations you plan to perform.

By following these steps and utilizing the provided schema, you should be able to classify and scale meals effectively, ensuring a well-organized and scalable database structure.
